## Welcome to my Tidy Tuesday Analyses!

Tidy Tuesday is an open-source data project that explores a new data set each week.
In an effort to sharpen my data skills, I have decided to do a new mini-project each week to showcase the different skills I have. Some weeks will focus on visualizations in R/Python, and some will focus more on modeling. Enjoy!
